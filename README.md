**GIFEE** is "Google's infrastructure for everyone else"

## What does it mean?

Who knows really. Google things for everyone?

## What is GitHub/GIFEE?

GitHub/GIFEE is a place to experiment with ideas based on Google's infrastructure and for reference architectures.

## What will be built?

GIFEE will initially be composed of some of Google's early foundational systems such as GFS, Chubby and BigTable.

## Will it be hosted?

GIFEE projects will likely be hosted at [gifee.cloud](http://gifee.cloud)

## Will it be Open Source?

Yes all GIFEE projects will be open source

## Can we contribute?

Yes. Whether it be reference architectures, docs, images, whatever. Please join in on the fun.
